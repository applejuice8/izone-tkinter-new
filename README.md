note: DO NOT SHARE WITH ANYONE ELSE OTHER THAN 6 OF US, even if they are your good friends, please dont share this
disclaimer: due to lack of testing data, this code may or may not work, please prepare for manual slot selection in case of an error occured

setup steps:
1. download zip file and open with vs code
2. enter the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies
3. open `main.py` and only modify the my_subjects list (if necessary) and there is no need to modify anything else. enter the subjects' names in lowercase to reduce time wasted for computer to convert the case. Note it is not required to enter the entire name, you can just enter a subpart of the name, as long as the substring is unique among all subjects. (Example 'information systems analysis & design' can be written as 'information systems' since it is the only information systems subject)
4. Currently the `testing` variable is set to `True` for testing the code. It needs to be changed to `False` during the actual scraping and selection.

execute program steps
1. run `main.py`
2. 2 windows will pop up, which are 'Class Schedule Viewer' and an empty Google Chrome window.
3. Ignore the 'Group 1 information systems' slot, that is just a placeholder (The code will break without it)
4.
